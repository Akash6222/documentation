Design is how it works.\u201d \u2014 Steve Jobs](reactjs.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *\u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d \u2014 Steve Jobs* |\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# What is React JS?\\n\\nReact JS is nothing but a java script library that helps the developers in creating reusable UI components there by increasing the efficiency of code. When making dynamic websites React JS is proven to be more effective than Vanilla JS, and hence it has become a popular choice for building fast and scalable single-page applications. In simple terms, ReactJS helps make web development more efficient, organized, and dynamic.\\n\\n# Characteristic Features of React JS that makes it more versatile and Popular\\n\\n| ![Features of ReactJS](characteristics.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Features of ReactJS* |\\n\\n## 1. Virtual DOM\\n\\nIn traditional web development, when changes are made to a web page, the entire page needs to be re-rendered, which can be slow and time-consuming. The Virtual DOM solves this issue by creating a virtual representation of the web page in memory so when changes are made, ReactJS updates the virtual DOM instead of the actual page, which is much faster. Then, ReactJS compares the virtual DOM to the actual page and updates only the parts that have changed, rather than the entire page. This makes the updates and rendering process much faster and more efficient, improving the overall user experience of the web application.\\n\\n## 2. Reusable Components\\n\\nReactJS uses a component-based architecture, which means that the user interface is built using reusable components. Each component is a self-contained unit that handles a specific task or displays a specific piece of information, we can say that each components are independent. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain, as well as reducing the amount of redundant code.\\n\\n## 3. Community\\n\\nReact has a vast and supportive community of developers who are constantly contributing new features and tools. React is open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of the library by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving existing ones.\\n\\n>[*Link to contribute to the React Library*](https://github.com/facebook/react)\\n\\n## 4. JSX\\n\\nJSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript used by ReactJS that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript. This makes it easier for users to write and understand the code, as it closely resembles the structure of HTML. This helps to improve the overall development experience by making the code more intuitive and easier to read.\\n\\nFor example, instead of writing the following code in pure JavaScript to render a simple button:\\n\\n```js \\nReact.createElement(\\"button\\", {className: \\"myButton\\"}, \\"Click Me!\\");\\n```\\n\\nThe same code can be written in JSX as:\\n\\n```jsx\\n<button className=\\"myButton\\">Click Me!</button>; \\n```\\n\\n## 5. Server-side Rendering\\n\\nServer-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the browser. In the case of React, this means that the React components can be rendered on the server, allowing the browser to receive a fully rendered HTML page, instead of having to wait for JavaScript to execute and render the page on the client side again and again.\\n\\nThis results in faster initial load times, as the browser doesn\u2019t have to wait for the JavaScript to execute and render the page. Additionally, server-side rendering can improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO), as search engines can better index and understand the content of the page.\\n\\n## 6. Compatibility\\n\\nReact\u2019s simplicity and straightforward design makes it easy for developers to learn and adopt and it works seamlessly with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux, allowing developers to create complex and scalable web applications.\\n\\n# Comaprison with other Frontend Frameworks\\n\\n| ![Popular Web Frameworks](chart1.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Comparison with other frameworks as per the recent survey* |\\n\\n>Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021\\n\\nFrom the above survey it can be clearly seen that React JS was named as one on the most commonly used web Framework.\\n\\nReact\u2019s virtual DOM provides fast updates and rendering compared to traditional DOM manipulation. Angular and Vue also have optimized updates, but they may not be as fast as React\u2019s virtual DOM.\\n\\nAlso, React is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach, making it relatively easy to learn and get started with. Angular, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve due to its more complex architecture. Vue falls somewhere in between, offering a more accessible learning experience as compared to Angular.\\n\\n:::info \\n\\nYou can see more detailed insights of React JS on their [**Official Website**](https://reactjs.org/)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, React is the future of web development, offering a robust set of features and tools that make it easy to build high-performing, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with other technologies make it an excellent choice for modern web development."},{"id":"intro-to-cloud-computing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/intro-to-cloud-computing","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-09-intro-to-cloud-computing/index.md","title":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","description":"This Blog talks about the emerging trends in Cloud computing, and also gives a gist about the term Cloud Computing and its impact in leveraging businesses and individuals.

The cloud has the ability to streamline and improve a variety of processes. From understanding the meaning of cloud computing model to discussing various characteristics, this blog will be your one-stop-shop for all things cloud computing. So, fasten your seatbelts and let\'s dive into the exciting world of the cloud together!!\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n# What is Cloud Computing ?  \\n\\nCloud computing is a way of using current technology where we can access and use internet-based services and storage to manage, process, and store data and information, instead of having to have it all on your own personal device or computer. \\n\\nWe can think of it like having access to a giant computer in the sky that we can use to do our work, store our files, and run our applications, without having to worry about the technical details or maintenance of the underlying hardware and software. This makes it easier and more convenient for us to access our data and resources from anywhere in the world, as long as we have an internet connection.\\n\\n\\n## Let\'s take a look at some intriguing features of Cloud Computing!!\\n<br />\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary><b>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f On-Demand Self-Service</b></summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nWith cloud computing, we can provision computing services, like server time and network storage, automatically. No communication with the service provider will be necessary. Customers of cloud services can view their cloud services, track their usage, and provision and de-provision services by logging into their cloud accounts through a web self-service portal.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\ud83d\udcbb Broad Network Access</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nBroad network connectivity is another crucial aspect of cloud computing. Through a network and on portable devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs, we can access cloud services. A private cloud employs a local area network, whereas a public cloud uses the internet. Broad network access and cloud computing both rely heavily on latency and bandwidth since they have an impact on service quality.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\ud83d\udcdd Resource Pooling</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nWith resource pooling, multiple customers can share physical resources using a multi-tenant model. Based on demand, this model distributes and redistributes real and virtual resources. Customers can share the same applications or infrastructure with multi-tenancy while still retaining their privacy and security. Customers may be able to designate the location of their resources at a higher level of abstraction, such as a country, state, or data centre, even though they won\'t know the precise location of their resources. Customers can pool a variety of resources, including memory, computing power, and bandwidth.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\ud83d\udd17 Rapid Elasticity</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nCloud services can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, so customers can scale quickly based on demand, thus making it highly scalable. The capabilities available for provisioning are practically unlimited. Customers can use these features whenever they want and in whatever amount. Customers can scale cloud capacity, cost, and usage without incurring additional contracts or charges. We won\'t need to acquire computer hardware thanks to quick elasticity. \\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\u2699\ufe0f Measured Service</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nA metering capability in cloud systems optimises resource utilisation at an abstraction level appropriate for the type of service. For storage, processing, bandwidth, and users, for instance, we can utilise a metered service. A pay-for-what-you-use model is used to base payments on the customer\'s actual consumption. Consumers and service providers benefit from a transparent experience that is created by monitoring, managing, and reporting resource use.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n## Lets have a look at some of the most used Cloud Storage Services\\n<br />\\n\\n| ![Most Used Cloud Storage Services](most-used-cloud-storage-services.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Most used Cloud Storage Services* |\\n\\nGoogle Drive is by far the most popular cloud storage service in the world, with an use rate of **94.44 percent**.

Here, we promote blogging in the student community. Talk about ongoing trends in tech, student life at TCET, and any topic you feel would feel great for this blog.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis particular blog will have recurring adjustments.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## General Blog Guidlines\\n\\nHere we define all the basic guidlines a blog should follow in TCET Open Source Blogs.\\n\\n### Clone the project\\n\\nFor being able to contribute anywhere, one must be able to clone and run projects. You can visit this [tutorial](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/projects/docs-site/getting-started) to learn how to work on this project.\\n\\n### Basic GitHub commands\\n\\nFor any contributor it is very necessary to understand basic GitHub commands to begin with. There is a _resources forum_ on **TCET - Open Source Discord server** where you can find relevant references for the same. There can also be a blog post regarding these commands in the future!\\n\\n### Understand file structure\\n\\nOnce you have cloned the project in your local storage, you will need to perform the following:\\n\\n1. Open the project directory and navigate to `blog/`.\\n2. Create a folder for your blog post.\\n* The folder should have the following name format:\\n```sh\\nyyyy-mm-dd-blog-title\\n```\\n* Here, the date stands for the date when the post is supposed to be released. The blog title should be relevant to the content within the post.\\n3. Within the folder, create `index.md`. This file will serve as a text document where you can format your content which will reflect in the final post.\\n\\n### Understand markdown files and syntax\\n\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The `index.md` file created in your blog folder is a markdown file, similar to how _index.html_ can be an HTML file. It is very essential for a blog contributor to understand the basic syntax of markdown. _Resource forum_ in our **Discord server** covers basic syntax of these files.\\n\\n### First steps\\n\\nBefore moving any further, a blogger must know the following:\\n\\n> - `slug` - It is the last part of the URL address that serves as a unique identifier of the blog post.\\n> - `title` - The main title of the blog post. Note that the blog title should be relevant to the content within the post.\\n> - `authors` - The list of authors who have worked on the blog post. Authors can be added by editing the `authors.yml` file.\\n> - `tags` - It highlights the key words of the post to boost it\'s visibility on the internet and improve the SEO.\\n\\nThese four information are necessary to be present in every post. Without these, no posts will be approved and merged within the blog.\\n\\n### Adding images\\n\\nTired of good ol\' _textbook nerdy_ look on your post? Introducing: **images**. Images are a great way to keep the reader\'s attention to your posts, and now you can do that very easily:\\n1. The image must be present within your blog folder. If it isn\'t, save the image in your blog folder.\\n2. To add the image within your post, use the following syntax:\\n```sh\\n![Alt text](image.png)\\n```\\n* Here, `image.png` stands for the name of the image you have in the blog directory. Markdown supports a great amount of image formats, ranging from png, jpg, svg, and even gifs.\\n\\n:::note\\nIs gif pronounced _gif_ or _jif_? Something to ponder upon.\\n:::\\n\\n### Congratulations\\n\\nFollowing these steps and points, you will be able to create a beautiful blog post. It\'s final structure would look something like this:\\n\\n![Alt text](structure.png)\\n\\n_With a fresh blog post ready, you can now finally create a pull request to reflect your post on our blog here!_\\n\\nLooking forward to new content from you all. Have fun and go contribute something great!"},{"id":"breaking-the-ice-open-source","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/breaking-the-ice-open-source","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-07-opensource/index.md","title":"Breaking The Ice - Open Source","description":"Project management is a wild way to make sure things are progressing as they should.

Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation. \\n\\nHere it is again in bigger letters, for impact:\\n\\n> ### Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.\\n\\nAnd now you know what open source is. _In theory, this blog post could be done!_\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Beyond the marketing standpoint\\n\\nTechnology is a concept which is ever-changing in how it is defined, its magnitude and how we as engineers develop it. In the world of technology we always find \\"buzz words\\" which reflect the recent advancements which are so efficient that they are slowly brought within the industry as a standard way of working on projects, as a team.\\n\\nOne such \\"buzz word\\" in the area of software development and project management is open source. Open source is a way of working on a software typically developed in a public, collaborative manner, with the source code made freely available to anyone who wants to use, modify, or distribute it. The term \\"open source\\" was coined in 1998 by a group of people in the software industry who wanted to create a new model of software development that was more collaborative and community-driven.\\n\\nOpen source software is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers and contributors, who work together to improve the software and fix bugs. Consider your **homework**: a dry document which contains things here and there which you know is very incomplete. If you have a good enough personality _(which I don\'t)_, you send this document to all your classmates who start doing bits of your homework.\\n\\n_The result?_ A fine specimen of a document which the entire class can show to your teachers for great marks! What you just did here was open sourcing your homework and let your student community work on it to create a more appealing document which is now complete.\\n\\n### But open source doesn\'t stop there\\n\\nImagine your homework to be your project, your classmates to be your community. This community observes your project and suggests various improvements within it. Be it suggesting simple changes of changing the fonts or re-working the already existing complex APIs and queries.\\n\\n| ![Example of suggestions](meme.jpg) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *A simple conversation between a contributor and a project developer* |\\n\\nAnother way to look at open source can be building the big **Lego City** together, block by block. Everyone can add their own pieces to what has been constructed so far and everyone can see how the city is made. In this way, everyone can make the city better and use it how they want.\\n\\n| ![Software Engineers](budding.jpg) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *Budding software engineers collaborating to build their project* |\\n\\nOpen source is a great way to bring like-minded developers together. Everybody around you, be a fresher student or an industry experienced individual, has had to encounter with open source technologies without even realizing it. From something we daily use like **Android** to **Linux**: the operating system used by many corporates and tech giants, there\'s no saying what the next big thing will be.\\n\\n| ![Open Source](open.jpg) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *Python, Dart, React, MongoDB, even this text box is open source* |\\n\\nThat\'s about the gist of what I wished to express regarding open source. Surely that\'s not everything but I do look forward to go in-depth into this topic and talk about various different things which excite me! Do look forward to upcoming blogposts and reach me out for any constructive criticism, if any, for the future blogposts."}]}')}}]);
