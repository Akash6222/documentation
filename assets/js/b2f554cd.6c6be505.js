APIs serve as mediators, enabling interoperability, data sharing, and communication between various software programmes. This article will provide you a thorough introduction to APIs and their importance in contemporary software development, whether you\'re a developer, a tech enthusiast, or just interested about the world of APIs._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nimport LaymanAPI from \\"./api-to-layman.png\\";\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src={LaymanAPI} style={{border: \\"2px solid grey\\"}}/>\\n  <center><figcaption>APIs to a layman</figcaption></center>\\n</figure>\\n\\n## Introduction to API\\n\\n\\n**Application Programming Interface** is referred to as API. It is a set of guidelines and protocols that specifies how various software components ought to communicate and share information. \\n- **APIs** can be thought of as a contract that enables successful communication between two software entities. \\n- **APIs** give programmers a standardised method of using the features of other software platforms, libraries, or systems.\\n\\n## Why are APIs Important?\\n\\nAPIs have revolutionized the way software is developed and integrated. Here are some key reasons why APIs are important:\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Seamless Integration\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\n    <p>By allowing various software systems to interact and cooperate, APIs enable developers to take advantage of already-existing functions and resources without having to start from scratch.</p>\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Extensibility and Scalability\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\n    <p>APIs give software developers a modular way to create new features, services, or data sources. As applications can be built upon existing APIs, promoting extensibility and scalability while saving time and effort.</p>\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Collaboration and Innovation\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\n    <p>By offering a standardised method of sharing data and services, APIs promote collaboration between developers and organisations. As a result, innovation is accelerated since developers can use APIs to build new apps or incorporate current systems into creative solutions.</p>\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"User Experience\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\n    <p>APIs make it easier to incorporate services or data sources from outside sources into applications, which improves the overall user experience. For instance, incorporating a weather API into a travel app gives users access to real-time weather information, enhancing the utility and appeal of the service.</p>\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n## Types of APIs\\n\\nAPIs come in different types and formats, depending on the purpose and underlying technology. Here are some common types of APIs:\\n\\n- **Web APIs:** These APIs allow web-based services and applications to communicate with one another. The majority of the time, they are built on widely used web protocols like `HTTP` and `REST` (Representational State Transfer).\\n\\n- **SOAP APIs:** Based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs offer a standardised method for applications to communicate structured information across a network.\\n\\n- **JSON-RPC and XML-RPC:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML can be used as the data format for remote procedure calls when using the `JSON-RPC` or `XML-RPC APIs`. They\'re frequently employed for lightweight.\\n\\n## API Communication Styles:\\n\\n- **RESTful APIs:** REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for designing web APIs. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to perform operations on resources. They often return data in formats like JSON or XML.\\n\\n- **GraphQL:** GraphQL is an alternative to RESTful APIs that provides a more flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval. With GraphQL, clients can specify the exact data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.\\n\\n- **Real-Time APIs:** Real-time APIs use technologies like WebSockets to enable bidirectional communication between the client and the server. They are ideal for applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications or real-time collaboration tools.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Common APIs\\n\\n- **Social media APIs:** Websites like **[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/)**, **[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)**, and **[Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/)** offer APIs that let programmers incorporate social media features into their applications, such as updating statuses, retrieving user profiles, or engaging with social networks.\\n\\n- **Payment Gateway APIs:** Companies such as **[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/)**, **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api)**, and **[Braintree](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs)** provide APIs for handling online payments, allowing developers to include secure payment processing into their apps.\\n\\n- **Mapping and Geolocation APIs:** Maps, geolocation data, routing, and other location-based services are all made available by mapping and geolocation APIs, which developers can use to build apps with mapping features. Examples of these APIs include **[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform)** and **[Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/)**.\\n\\n\\nimport apis from \\"./apis.png\\";\\n\\n<img src={apis}/>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAPIs enable seamless integration, teamwork, and creativity, serving as the foundation for contemporary software development. For developers and organisations wishing to take use of the power of APIs to build strong and interconnected applications, understanding APIs and their many types, communication styles, authentication methods, documentation practises, and management systems is essential. So go ahead and discover the immense possibilities that APIs contain for your software applications by exploring their enormous world!"},{"id":"tmai-may-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tmai-may-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-06-tmai-may-23/index.md","title":"This Month in AI - May 2023","description":"Latest News & Breakthroughs in the Month of May 2023 in AI/ML/DS.","date":"2023-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"mind-benders","permalink":"/blog/tags/mind-benders"},{"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"label":"tmai","permalink":"/blog/tags/tmai"}],"readingTime":5.095,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kunal Agrawal","title":"President - Mind Benders | SSoC\'22","url":"https://github.com/kunalagra","image_url":"https://github.com/kunalagra.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/kunalagra.png"},{"name":"Keval Waghate","title":"Publication Head - Mind Benders","url":"https://github.com/KevalW","image_url":"https://github.com/KevalW.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/KevalW.png"},{"name":"Deexith Madas","title":"Treasurer -  Mind Benders","url":"https://github.com/MDeexith","image_url":"https://github.com/MDeexith.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/MDeexith.png"},{"name":"Ananta Pandey","title":"Jt.

Join us as we explore different aspects of Artificial Intelligence in this entire series.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is an exciting and rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform our world in countless ways. From self-driving cars to virtual personal assistants, AI has already made its way into many aspects of our daily lives, and its applications continue to expand.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence is composed of two words **Artificial** and **Intelligence**, where Artificial defines _\u201cman-made,\u201d_ and intelligence defines _\u201cthinking power\u201d_, hence AI means _\u201ca man-made thinking power.\u201d_\\n\\n> Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.\\n\\nBut what exactly is AI, and how did it come to be? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at the history of AI and its evolution over time.\\n\\n### Early Concepts of AI\\n\\n\\nThe idea of machines that could mimic human intelligence dates back centuries, with early examples including the ancient Greek myths of Talos, a giant bronze statue that could move and act on its own, and Pygmalion\u2019s statue, which was brought to life by the goddess Aphrodite.\\n\\n| ![Figure 1 - Talos](Talos.webp) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Figure 1 \u2014 Talos by [**Adrienne Mayor**](https://technicacuriosa.com/author/amayor/)* |\\n\\nIn the modern era, the concept of AI began to take shape in the mid-20th century. In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the \u201cTuring Test,\u201d which is still used today to measure a machine\u2019s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\\n\\nEarly AI research focused on rule-based systems, in which machines were programmed to follow a set of explicit rules to solve problems. While these systems were effective for some tasks, they were limited by their inflexibility and inability to learn from experience.\\n\\nAI has many sub-categories like Machine Learning and Deep Learning. People usually tend to use these terms interchangeably. Let\u2019s look at these terms in brief -\\n\\n\\n| ![Figure 2 - Sub-categories of AI](sub-categories-of-AI.webp) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Figure 2 \u2014 By the [Author](https://medium.com/@nidhiworah02) \u2014 Types of Artificial Intelligence* |\\n\\n\\n## The Rise of Machine Learning\\n\\n\\nIn the 1980s, a new approach to AI emerged: Machine Learning. This approach involved designing algorithms that could learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions based on that data.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms were initially used for simple tasks such as recognizing handwritten characters, but their applications quickly expanded to more complex problems, including speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing.\\n\\n## Deep Learning and Neural Networks\\n\\n\\nIn the 2010s, a subfield of machine learning known as deep learning began to emerge, fueled by advances in computing power and data storage. Deep learning algorithms are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, using artificial neural networks to simulate the behavior of neurons and synapses.       \\n\\nDeep learning has enabled breakthroughs in areas such as image and speech recognition and has led to the development of autonomous vehicles and other advanced technologies.\\n\\n## The Future of AI\\n\\n\\nAs AI continues to advance, its potential applications are virtually limitless. From personalized healthcare to smart homes and cities, AI has the power to revolutionize nearly every aspect of our lives.\\n\\nAs Uncle Ben says, \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d AI systems become more sophisticated, it\u2019s important to ensure that they are designed and deployed ethically and responsibly, with consideration for issues such as bias, privacy, and security.\\n\\n## Types of Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n\\n| ![Figure 3 - Types of AI](types-of-AI.webp) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Figure 3 \u2014 By the [Author](https://medium.com/@nidhiworah02) \u2014 Types of Artificial Intelligence* |\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n### Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Type 1: Based on Capabilities\\n\\n**Narrow AI**\\n\\n*   Narrow AI is a type of AI that is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.\\n*   Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.\\n*   Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce sites, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.     \\n\\n**General AI**\\n\\n*   General AI is a type of intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.\\n*   The idea behind the general AI is to make such a system that could be smarter and think like a human on its own.\\n*   It is currently a hypothetical concept, and we don\u2019t yet have any real-world examples of this type of AI.\\n\\n**Super AI**\\n\\n*   Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than humans with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.\\n*   Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. The development of such systems in real is still world changing task.\\n\\n### Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Type 2: Based on Functionality\\n\\n**Reactive Machines**\\n\\n*   Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.\\n*   Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.\\n*   These machines only focus on current scenarios and react to them as per the possible best action.\\n*   Examples: IBM\u2019s Deep Blue system, Google\u2019s AlphaGo\\n\\n**Limited Memory**\\n\\n*   Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.\\n*   These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.\\n*   Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These cars can store the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, \\nthe speed limit, and other information to navigate the road.\\n\\n**Theory Of Mind**\\n\\n*   Theory of Mind AI should understand human emotions, people, and beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.\\n*   This type of AI machine is still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvements for developing such AI machines.\\n\\n**Self-Awareness**\\n\\n*   Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and \\nself-awareness.\\n*   These machines will be smarter than the human mind.\\n*   Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\\nArtificial intelligence has come a long way since the early days of rule-based systems, and its evolution shows no signs of slowing down. With ongoing research \\nand development, the potential applications of AI are vast and ever-expanding.\\n\\nIf you enjoy reading stories on similar topics then do [follow](https://medium.com/@nidhiworah02/subscribe) the account.

This could be useful in a range of sectors\u2014for example, metals that perform well at lower temperatures could improve spacecraft, while metals that resist corrosion could be used for boats and submarines.\\nUsually they start off with one well-known element, like iron, which is cheap and malleable, and add one or two others to see the effect on the original material. It\u2019s a laborious process of trial and error that inevitably yields more duds than useful results.\\nResearchers from the Max Planck Institute managed to identify 17 promising new metals using this method.\\n\\n## Revolutionizing ML: Researchers Unveil a More Agile Approach [^7]\\n\\nArtificial intelligence researchers have celebrated a string of successes with neural networks, computer programs that roughly mimic how our brains are organized. In 2020, two researchers at the MIT led a team that introduced a new kind of neural network based on real-life intelligence \u2014 but not our own. After a breakthrough last year, the novel networks may now be versatile enough to supplant their traditional counterparts for certain applications.\\n\\nLiquid neural networks offer an elegant and compact alternative , said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at the University of California, Berkeley. These networks can run faster and more accurately than other so-called continuous-time neural networks, which model systems that vary over time\\n\\n\\n[^1]: [https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/)\\n\\n[^2]: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-ai-can-help-you-land-your-dream-job-step-by-step-hemachandran/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-ai-can-help-you-land-your-dream-job-step-by-step-hemachandran/)\\n\\n[^3]: [https://deci.ai/blog/yolo-nas-object-detection-foundation-model/](https://deci.ai/blog/yolo-nas-object-detection-foundation-model/)\\n\\n[^4]: [https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/amp/](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/amp/)\\n\\n[^5]: [https://theconversation.com/ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-says-ai-is-a-new-form-of-intelligence-unlike-our-own-have-we-been-getting-it-wrong-this-whole-time-204911](https://theconversation.com/ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-says-ai-is-a-new-form-of-intelligence-unlike-our-own-have-we-been-getting-it-wrong-this-whole-time-204911)\\n\\n[^6]: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1062104/machine-learning-new-metals](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1062104/machine-learning-new-metals)\\n\\n[^7]: [https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-discover-a-more-flexible-approach-to-machine-learning-20230207](https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-discover-a-more-flexible-approach-to-machine-learning-20230207)"},{"id":"rotaract-club-of-tcet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/rotaract-club-of-tcet","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-15-rcblog/index.md","title":"Rotaract Club of TCET","description":"About Rotaract Club of TCET","date":"2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cultural","permalink":"/blog/tags/cultural"},{"label":"social","permalink":"/blog/tags/social"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"editorial","permalink":"/blog/tags/editorial"}],"readingTime":5.255,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nikita Shukla","title":"Docs Team Member | Chairperson HRD @RCTCET","url":"https://github.com/NikitaSShukla","imageURL":"https://github.com/NikitaSShukla.png","key":"nikita"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rotaract-club-of-tcet","title":"Rotaract Club of TCET","authors":["nikita"],"tags":["cultural","social","community","editorial"],"description":"About Rotaract Club of TCET","keywords":["cultural","social","community","editorial"]},"prevItem":{"title":"This Month in AI - April 2023","permalink":"/blog/tmai-april-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Dive into Web Design \ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f | Learn the Mental Model for converting Designs into Code","permalink":"/blog/dive-into-web-design"}},"content":">Are you one of those engineers who are just engrossed in academics and is looking to do something more than that in your college days?

Even after watching HTML and CSS tutorials, we can still struggle to design anything in web. But, after having a decent **understanding of divisions** into **rows** and **columns** and learning about **display properties and positioning** in detail, you we can have some confidence to **turn any Figma design to HTML and CSS**. This is not a tutorial on HTML & CSS but a comprehensive usage of them. By reading this blog, I hope you can get the confidence and create the **Mental Model of Web Design in your Brain** \u2728\\n\\nThis Blog also serves as a very precise summary of long web design bootcamp I took with [**GenosisX Tech Community](https://twitter.com/genosis_x), [*watch here*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMSrWOO6hvLqdfCkNaQ1GhslVzvKygjU0)**\\n\\n> TL;DR: Create proper rows and columns for each block of design, put them into proper semantic tags or `<div>` tags. Use display flex or grid on them. Then style them properly with the fonts, colors, paddings, margins, borders, backgrounds. Position them properly with position property of CSS. Use responsive features of flex and grid. Done!\\n> \\n\\n## Prerequisite\\n\\n- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS would help, but not necessary.\\n- That\u2019s It!\\n\\n# Guide to Divisions\\n\\nMaking proper divisions of design into rows and columns will help you style them better and will make it 100x easier to make them responsive.

[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)\\n\\n## Step-by-Step Linear Process to Design Anything!\\n\\nRemember, this is not a hard and fast rule to follow exactly as is. You can add you own flavours to this. Skip steps which are not required. I made this using my personal experience so add modify it if I missed anything. \\n\\n1. Write HTML, using the divisions approach\\n2. Set background color\\n3. Set display - flex (if any child tags)\\n4. Set width - compulsory\\n5. Set height - optional\\n6. set overflow properties\\n7. Set font \u2192 size, weight, line height, letter spacing, \\n8. Set text colors \u2192 paddings \u2192 borders \u2192 margins \\n    1. Colors - normal, hover, active any states\\n    2. Borders - width/thickness , color, radius, style\\n9. Set position (if want to move the element from its position)\\n    1. relative - move it from its current position\\n    2. absolute - move it from its **first relative parent** start point (top-0, left-0 of relative parent)\\n    3. fixed - move it from windows start point (top-0, left-0 of whole window)\\n10. Set z-index - define stack, which element should be above which\\n11. Anything else that suits your design\\n\\nThis is a linear process, which means you first style the first tag then the second tag then the third tag then the next tag then the next tag and so on!\\n\\n```html\\n<body> \x3c!-- First style this #1 --\x3e\\n  <header>\x3c!-- then this #2 --\x3e\\n    <img src=\\"/..\\" /> \x3c!-- Then this #3 --\x3e\\n    <nav> \x3c!-- Then this #4 --\x3e\\n      <a>..</a> \x3c!-- Then this #5 --\x3e\\n      <a>..</a> \x3c!-- Then this #6 --\x3e\\n      <a>..</a> \x3c!-- Then this #7 --\x3e\\n    </nav> \x3c!-- and so on till the last tag --\x3e\\n    <button>Sign up</button> \\n  </header> \\n  <main> \\n    <section> \\n      <h1>Main text...</h1>\\n      <p>Description text...</p>\\n      <span>\\n        <button>Get Started</button>\\n        <button>Order Now</button>\\n      </span>\\n    </section> \\n\\t\\t<section> \\n      <img src=\\"/..\\" />\\n    </section>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\n## Here comes the CSS\\n\\n![Web Design Bootcamp Design](https://ik.imagekit.io/okaydokeymypath/blogs/deep-dive-into-web-design/web_design.png)\\n\\nWeb Design Bootcamp Design\\n\\nTake a quick look, and we will start with the linear process\\n\\n### Body -

Whether you are just starting out with web development or are looking to enhance your existing skills, I hope that you will find valuable insights and tips within these pages.\\nSo sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and join me on our journey through the exciting world of ReactJS!\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n| ![\u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d \u2014 Steve Jobs](reactjs.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *\u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d \u2014 Steve Jobs* |\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# What is React JS?\\n\\nReact JS is nothing but a java script library that helps the developers in creating reusable UI components there by increasing the efficiency of code. When making dynamic websites React JS is proven to be more effective than Vanilla JS, and hence it has become a popular choice for building fast and scalable single-page applications. In simple terms, ReactJS helps make web development more efficient, organized, and dynamic.\\n\\n# Characteristic Features of React JS that makes it more versatile and Popular\\n\\n| ![Features of ReactJS](characteristics.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Features of ReactJS* |\\n\\n## 1. Virtual DOM\\n\\nIn traditional web development, when changes are made to a web page, the entire page needs to be re-rendered, which can be slow and time-consuming. The Virtual DOM solves this issue by creating a virtual representation of the web page in memory so when changes are made, ReactJS updates the virtual DOM instead of the actual page, which is much faster. Then, ReactJS compares the virtual DOM to the actual page and updates only the parts that have changed, rather than the entire page. This makes the updates and rendering process much faster and more efficient, improving the overall user experience of the web application.\\n\\n## 2. Reusable Components\\n\\nReactJS uses a component-based architecture, which means that the user interface is built using reusable components. Each component is a self-contained unit that handles a specific task or displays a specific piece of information, we can say that each components are independent. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain, as well as reducing the amount of redundant code.\\n\\n## 3. Community\\n\\nReact has a vast and supportive community of developers who are constantly contributing new features and tools. React is open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of the library by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving existing ones.\\n\\n>[*Link to contribute to the React Library*](https://github.com/facebook/react)\\n\\n## 4. JSX\\n\\nJSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript used by ReactJS that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript. This makes it easier for users to write and understand the code, as it closely resembles the structure of HTML. This helps to improve the overall development experience by making the code more intuitive and easier to read.\\n\\nFor example, instead of writing the following code in pure JavaScript to render a simple button:\\n\\n```js \\nReact.createElement(\\"button\\", {className: \\"myButton\\"}, \\"Click Me!\\");\\n```\\n\\nThe same code can be written in JSX as:\\n\\n```jsx\\n<button className=\\"myButton\\">Click Me!</button>; \\n```\\n\\n## 5. Server-side Rendering\\n\\nServer-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the browser. In the case of React, this means that the React components can be rendered on the server, allowing the browser to receive a fully rendered HTML page, instead of having to wait for JavaScript to execute and render the page on the client side again and again.\\n\\nThis results in faster initial load times, as the browser doesn\u2019t have to wait for the JavaScript to execute and render the page. Additionally, server-side rendering can improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO), as search engines can better index and understand the content of the page.\\n\\n## 6. Compatibility\\n\\nReact\u2019s simplicity and straightforward design makes it easy for developers to learn and adopt and it works seamlessly with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux, allowing developers to create complex and scalable web applications.\\n\\n# Comaprison with other Frontend Frameworks\\n\\n| ![Popular Web Frameworks](chart1.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Comparison with other frameworks as per the recent survey* |\\n\\n>Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021\\n\\nFrom the above survey it can be clearly seen that React JS was named as one on the most commonly used web Framework.\\n\\nReact\u2019s virtual DOM provides fast updates and rendering compared to traditional DOM manipulation. Angular and Vue also have optimized updates, but they may not be as fast as React\u2019s virtual DOM.\\n\\nAlso, React is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach, making it relatively easy to learn and get started with. Angular, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve due to its more complex architecture. Vue falls somewhere in between, offering a more accessible learning experience as compared to Angular.\\n\\n:::info \\n\\nYou can see more detailed insights of React JS on their [**Official Website**](https://reactjs.org/)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, React is the future of web development, offering a robust set of features and tools that make it easy to build high-performing, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with other technologies make it an excellent choice for modern web development."},{"id":"intro-to-cloud-computing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/intro-to-cloud-computing","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-09-intro-to-cloud-computing/index.md","title":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","description":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","date":"2023-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 9, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cloud computing","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-computing"},{"label":"data","permalink":"/blog/tags/data"},{"label":"source","permalink":"/blog/tags/source"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/blog/tags/software"}],"readingTime":5.505,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu Agarwal","title":"Docs Team Lead | 2x Kaggle Expert | Software Developer | Data Analyst","url":"https://github.com/himanshu-03","imageURL":"https://github.com/himanshu-03.png","key":"himanshu"},{"name":"Mahima Churi","title":"UI/UX Team Member | Full Stack Web Developer","url":"https://github.com/Mahitej28","imageURL":"https://github.com/Mahitej28.png","key":"mahima"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intro-to-cloud-computing","title":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","authors":["himanshu","mahima"],"tags":["cloud computing","data","source","software"],"description":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","keywords":["cloud computing","data","source","software"]},"prevItem":{"title":"6 Reasons Why React JS is the Future of Web Development!!","permalink":"/blog/intro-to-react-js"},"nextItem":{"title":"Breaking The Ice - Open Source","permalink":"/blog/breaking-the-ice-open-source"}},"content":"> This Blog talks about the emerging trends in Cloud computing, and also gives a gist about the term Cloud Computing and its impact in leveraging businesses and individuals. The cloud has the ability to streamline and improve a variety of processes. From understanding the meaning of cloud computing model to discussing various characteristics, this blog will be your one-stop-shop for all things cloud computing. So, fasten your seatbelts and let\'s dive into the exciting world of the cloud together!!\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n# What is Cloud Computing ?  \\n\\nCloud computing is a way of using current technology where we can access and use internet-based services and storage to manage, process, and store data and information, instead of having to have it all on your own personal device or computer. \\n\\nWe can think of it like having access to a giant computer in the sky that we can use to do our work, store our files, and run our applications, without having to worry about the technical details or maintenance of the underlying hardware and software. This makes it easier and more convenient for us to access our data and resources from anywhere in the world, as long as we have an internet connection.\\n\\n\\n## Let\'s take a look at some intriguing features of Cloud Computing!!\\n<br />\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary><b>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f On-Demand Self-Service</b></summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nWith cloud computing, we can provision computing services, like server time and network storage, automatically. No communication with the service provider will be necessary. Customers of cloud services can view their cloud services, track their usage, and provision and de-provision services by logging into their cloud accounts through a web self-service portal.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\ud83d\udcbb Broad Network Access</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nBroad network connectivity is another crucial aspect of cloud computing. Through a network and on portable devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs, we can access cloud services. A private cloud employs a local area network, whereas a public cloud uses the internet. Broad network access and cloud computing both rely heavily on latency and bandwidth since they have an impact on service quality.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\ud83d\udcdd Resource Pooling</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nWith resource pooling, multiple customers can share physical resources using a multi-tenant model. Based on demand, this model distributes and redistributes real and virtual resources. Customers can share the same applications or infrastructure with multi-tenancy while still retaining their privacy and security. Customers may be able to designate the location of their resources at a higher level of abstraction, such as a country, state, or data centre, even though they won\'t know the precise location of their resources. Customers can pool a variety of resources, including memory, computing power, and bandwidth.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\ud83d\udd17 Rapid Elasticity</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nCloud services can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, so customers can scale quickly based on demand, thus making it highly scalable. The capabilities available for provisioning are practically unlimited. Customers can use these features whenever they want and in whatever amount. Customers can scale cloud capacity, cost, and usage without incurring additional contracts or charges. We won\'t need to acquire computer hardware thanks to quick elasticity. \\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n<b>\u2699\ufe0f Measured Service</b>\\n</summary>\\n<div>\\n\\nA metering capability in cloud systems optimises resource utilisation at an abstraction level appropriate for the type of service. For storage, processing, bandwidth, and users, for instance, we can utilise a metered service. A pay-for-what-you-use model is used to base payments on the customer\'s actual consumption. Consumers and service providers benefit from a transparent experience that is created by monitoring, managing, and reporting resource use.\\n\\n</div>\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n## Lets have a look at some of the most used Cloud Storage Services\\n<br />\\n\\n| ![Most Used Cloud Storage Services](most-used-cloud-storage-services.png) |\\n| :--: |\\n| *Most used Cloud Storage Services* |\\n\\nGoogle Drive is by far the most popular cloud storage service in the world, with an use rate of **94.44 percent**.

There is a project management technique for everything. Well, almost everything. I haven\'t found a project managing concept to overcome my feelings of procrastination. Someone might create it one day.\\n\\n## What really _is_ Open Source?\\n\\nIf you\'re the engineering type of person that tackles humanity\'s problems and urgent needs by bringing together an entire community and building a \\"project\\" with them, you\'ll want to know about **Open source**. Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation. \\n\\nHere it is again in bigger letters, for impact:\\n\\n> ### Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.\\n\\nAnd now you know what open source is. _In theory, this blog post could be done!_\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Beyond the marketing standpoint\\n\\nTechnology is a concept which is ever-changing in how it is defined, its magnitude and how we as engineers develop it. In the world of technology we always find \\"buzz words\\" which reflect the recent advancements which are so efficient that they are slowly brought within the industry as a standard way of working on projects, as a team.\\n\\nOne such \\"buzz word\\" in the area of software development and project management is open source. Open source is a way of working on a software typically developed in a public, collaborative manner, with the source code made freely available to anyone who wants to use, modify, or distribute it. The term \\"open source\\" was coined in 1998 by a group of people in the software industry who wanted to create a new model of software development that was more collaborative and community-driven.\\n\\nOpen source software is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers and contributors, who work together to improve the software and fix bugs. Consider your **homework**: a dry document which contains things here and there which you know is very incomplete. If you have a good enough personality _(which I don\'t)_, you send this document to all your classmates who start doing bits of your homework.\\n\\n_The result?_ A fine specimen of a document which the entire class can show to your teachers for great marks! What you just did here was open sourcing your homework and let your student community work on it to create a more appealing document which is now complete.\\n\\n### But open source doesn\'t stop there\\n\\nImagine your homework to be your project, your classmates to be your community. This community observes your project and suggests various improvements within it. Be it suggesting simple changes of changing the fonts or re-working the already existing complex APIs and queries.\\n\\n| ![Example of suggestions](meme.jpg) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *A simple conversation between a contributor and a project developer* |\\n\\nAnother way to look at open source can be building the big **Lego City** together, block by block. Everyone can add their own pieces to what has been constructed so far and everyone can see how the city is made. In this way, everyone can make the city better and use it how they want.\\n\\n| ![Software Engineers](budding.jpg) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *Budding software engineers collaborating to build their project* |\\n\\nOpen source is a great way to bring like-minded developers together. Everybody around you, be a fresher student or an industry experienced individual, has had to encounter with open source technologies without even realizing it. From something we daily use like **Android** to **Linux**: the operating system used by many corporates and tech giants, there\'s no saying what the next big thing will be.\\n\\n| ![Open Source](open.jpg) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *Python, Dart, React, MongoDB, even this text box is open source* |\\n\\nThat\'s about the gist of what I wished to express regarding open source. Surely that\'s not everything but I do look forward to go in-depth into this topic and talk about various different things which excite me! Do look forward to upcoming blogposts and reach me out for any constructive criticism, if any, for the future blogposts."},{"id":"blog-posting-guidelines","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/blog-posting-guidelines","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-01-blog-guidlines/index.md","title":"First Blog - General Posting Guidelines","description":"First Blog - General Posting Guidelines","date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"free","permalink":"/blog/tags/free"},{"label":"open","permalink":"/blog/tags/open"},{"label":"source","permalink":"/blog/tags/source"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/blog/tags/software"}],"readingTime":3.835,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurang Vishwakarma","title":"Creator of TCET Open Source, DevOps Lead","url":"https://github.com/demonkillerr","imageURL":"https://github.com/demonkillerr.png","key":"gaurang"},{"name":"Vishal Rawat","title":"Co-creator TCET Open Source, Docs Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/vish-rt","imageURL":"https://github.com/vish-rt.png","key":"vishal"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"blog-posting-guidelines","title":"First Blog - General Posting Guidelines","authors":["gaurang","vishal"],"tags":["free","open","source","software"],"description":"First Blog - General Posting Guidelines","keywords":["free","open","source","software"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Breaking The Ice - Open Source","permalink":"/blog/breaking-the-ice-open-source"}},"content":"## Welcome to our first blog\\n\\nWelcome everyone to TCET Open Source\'s Blog Section.

Create a folder for your blog post.\\n* The folder should have the following name format:\\n```sh\\nyyyy-mm-dd-blog-title\\n```\\n* Here, the date stands for the date when the post is supposed to be released. The blog title should be relevant to the content within the post.\\n3. Within the folder, create `index.md`. This file will serve as a text document where you can format your content which will reflect in the final post.\\n\\n### Understand markdown files and syntax\\n\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The `index.md` file created in your blog folder is a markdown file, similar to how _index.html_ can be an HTML file. It is very essential for a blog contributor to understand the basic syntax of markdown. _Resource forum_ in our **Discord server** covers basic syntax of these files.\\n\\n### First steps\\n\\nBefore moving any further, a blogger must know the following:\\n\\n> - `slug` - It is the last part of the URL address that serves as a unique identifier of the blog post.\\n> - `title` - The main title of the blog post. Note that the blog title should be relevant to the content within the post.\\n> - `authors` - The list of authors who have worked on the blog post. Look below to understand how to add authors.\\n> - `tags` - It highlights the key words of the post to boost it\'s visibility on the internet and improve the SEO.\\n\\nThese four information are necessary to be present in every post. Without these, no posts will be approved and merged within the blog.\\n\\n\\n:::info Mention Authors\\n\\nAuthors can be added in two ways.\\n- Internally in `index.md` (recommended, for outside organization contributors)\\n- In the `authors.yml` file. (**TCET Open Source Members only**)\\n\\nIf you are not a member of the organization, you can simply append your author(s) in the following way:\\n\\n```md\\nauthors:\\n  - name: Name of Author 1\\n    title: Designation, Post or About\\n    url: https://github.com/author1\\n    image_url: https://github.com/author1.png\\n  - name: Name of Author 2\\n    title: Designation, Post or About\\n    url: https://github.com/author1\\n    image_url: https://github.com/author2.png\\n```\\n#### Important things to take note of:\\n- `url:` can also be an authors\' personal website or portfolio.\\n- `image_url:` requires a user to have a profile pic on their Github Account. We recommend to append a Github Profile Icon.\\n\\n\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Adding images\\n\\nTired of good ol\' _textbook nerdy_ look on your post? Introducing: **images**. Images are a great way to keep the reader\'s attention to your posts, and now you can do that very easily:\\n1. The image must be present within your blog folder. If it isn\'t, save the image in your blog folder.\\n2. To add the image within your post, use the following syntax:\\n```sh\\n![Alt text](image.png)\\n```\\n* Here, `image.png` stands for the name of the image you have in the blog directory. Markdown supports a great amount of image formats, ranging from png, jpg, svg, and even gifs.\\n\\n:::note WONDERING\\nIs gif pronounced _gif_ or _jif_? Something to ponder upon.\\n:::\\n\\n### Congratulations\\n\\nFollowing these steps and points, you will be able to create a beautiful blog post. It\'s final structure would look something like this:\\n\\n![Alt text](structure.png)\\n\\n_With a fresh blog post ready, you can now finally create a pull request to reflect your post on our blog here!_\\n\\nLooking forward to new content from you all. Have fun and go contribute something great!"}]}')}}]);
