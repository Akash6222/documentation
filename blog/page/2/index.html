From self-driving cars to virtual personal assistants, AI has already made its way into many aspects of our daily lives, and its applications continue to expand.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words <strong>Artificial</strong> and <strong>Intelligence</strong>, where Artificial defines <em>‚Äúman-made,‚Äù</em> and intelligence defines <em>‚Äúthinking power‚Äù</em>, hence AI means <em>‚Äúa man-made thinking power.‚Äù</em></p><blockquote><p>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.</p></blockquote><p>But what exactly is AI, and how did it come to be?

In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the ‚ÄúTuring Test,‚Äù which is still used today to measure a machine‚Äôs ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.</p><p>Early AI research focused on rule-based systems, in which machines were programmed to follow a set of explicit rules to solve problems. While these systems were effective for some tasks, they were limited by their inflexibility and inability to learn from experience.</p><p>AI has many sub-categories like Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Usually they start off with one well-known element, like iron, which is cheap and malleable, and add one or two others to see the effect on the original material. It‚Äôs a laborious process of trial and error that inevitably yields more duds than useful results.
