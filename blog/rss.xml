            <description><![CDATA[Why React JS is the Future of Web Development]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><b>As</b> technology continues to evolve, web development has become an increasingly important field, and front-end frameworks such as ReactJS have emerged as crucial tools for building dynamic, user-friendly websites. Whether you are just starting out with web development or are looking to enhance your existing skills, I hope that you will find valuable insights and tips within these pages. So sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and join me on our journey through the exciting world of ReactJS!</blockquote><br><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” — Steve Jobs" src="/assets/images/reactjs-c0e8ca45355fd1d3795bac16f3a9d5ba.png" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” — Steve Jobs</em></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h1>What is React JS?</h1><p>React JS is nothing but a java script library that helps the developers in creating reusable UI components there by increasing the efficiency of code. When making dynamic websites React JS is proven to be more effective than Vanilla JS, and hence it has become a popular choice for building fast and scalable single-page applications. In simple terms, ReactJS helps make web development more efficient, organized, and dynamic.</p><h1>Characteristic Features of React JS that makes it more versatile and Popular</h1><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Features of ReactJS" src="/assets/images/characteristics-125cdd46a3b8383771d4052fb7c4840b.png" width="1246" height="848" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Features of ReactJS</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-virtual-dom">1. Virtual DOM<a href="#1-virtual-dom" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Virtual DOM" title="Direct link to 1. Virtual DOM">​</a></h2><p>In traditional web development, when changes are made to a web page, the entire page needs to be re-rendered, which can be slow and time-consuming. The Virtual DOM solves this issue by creating a virtual representation of the web page in memory so when changes are made, ReactJS updates the virtual DOM instead of the actual page, which is much faster. Then, ReactJS compares the virtual DOM to the actual page and updates only the parts that have changed, rather than the entire page. This makes the updates and rendering process much faster and more efficient, improving the overall user experience of the web application.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-reusable-components">2. Reusable Components<a href="#2-reusable-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Reusable Components" title="Direct link to 2. Reusable Components">​</a></h2><p>ReactJS uses a component-based architecture, which means that the user interface is built using reusable components. Each component is a self-contained unit that handles a specific task or displays a specific piece of information, we can say that each components are independent. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain, as well as reducing the amount of redundant code.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-community">3. Community<a href="#3-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Community" title="Direct link to 3. Community">​</a></h2><p>React has a vast and supportive community of developers who are constantly contributing new features and tools. React is open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of the library by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving existing ones.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Link to contribute to the React Library</em></a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-jsx">4. JSX<a href="#4-jsx" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. JSX" title="Direct link to 4. JSX">​</a></h2><p>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript used by ReactJS that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript. This makes it easier for users to write and understand the code, as it closely resembles the structure of HTML. This helps to improve the overall development experience by making the code more intuitive and easier to read.</p><p>For example, instead of writing the following code in pure JavaScript to render a simple button:</p><div class="language-js codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-js codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token maybe-class-name">React</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token method function property-access" style="color:#d73a49">createElement</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"button"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">className</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"myButton"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"Click Me!"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>The same code can be written in JSX as:</p><div class="language-jsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-jsx codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&lt;</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f">button</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f"> </span><span class="token tag attr-name" style="color:#00a4db">className</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation attr-equals" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation" style="color:#393A34">"</span><span class="token tag attr-value" style="color:#e3116c">myButton</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation" style="color:#393A34">"</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain-text">Click Me!</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&lt;/</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f">button</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-server-side-rendering">5. Server-side Rendering<a href="#5-server-side-rendering" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Server-side Rendering" title="Direct link to 5. Server-side Rendering">​</a></h2><p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the browser. In the case of React, this means that the React components can be rendered on the server, allowing the browser to receive a fully rendered HTML page, instead of having to wait for JavaScript to execute and render the page on the client side again and again.</p><p>This results in faster initial load times, as the browser doesn’t have to wait for the JavaScript to execute and render the page. Additionally, server-side rendering can improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO), as search engines can better index and understand the content of the page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-compatibility">6. Compatibility<a href="#6-compatibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. Compatibility" title="Direct link to 6.

Angular and Vue also have optimized updates, but they may not be as fast as React’s virtual DOM.</p><p>Also, React is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach, making it relatively easy to learn and get started with. Angular, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve due to its more complex architecture. Vue falls somewhere in between, offering a more accessible learning experience as compared to Angular.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>You can see more detailed insights of React JS on their <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Official Website</strong></a></p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, React is the future of web development, offering a robust set of features and tools that make it easy to build high-performing, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This Blog talks about the emerging trends in Cloud computing, and also gives a gist about the term Cloud Computing and its impact in leveraging businesses and individuals. The cloud has the ability to streamline and improve a variety of processes. From understanding the meaning of cloud computing model to discussing various characteristics, this blog will be your one-stop-shop for all things cloud computing. So, fasten your seatbelts and let's dive into the exciting world of the cloud together!!</p></blockquote><br><h1>What is Cloud Computing ?</h1><p>Cloud computing is a way of using current technology where we can access and use internet-based services and storage to manage, process, and store data and information, instead of having to have it all on your own personal device or computer. </p><p>We can think of it like having access to a giant computer in the sky that we can use to do our work, store our files, and run our applications, without having to worry about the technical details or maintenance of the underlying hardware and software. This makes it easier and more convenient for us to access our data and resources from anywhere in the world, as long as we have an internet connection.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-take-a-look-at-some-intriguing-features-of-cloud-computing">Let's take a look at some intriguing features of Cloud Computing!!<a href="#lets-take-a-look-at-some-intriguing-features-of-cloud-computing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let's take a look at some intriguing features of Cloud Computing!!" title="Direct link to Let's take a look at some intriguing features of Cloud Computing!!">​</a></h2><br><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>🛠️ On-Demand Self-Service</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><p>With cloud computing, we can provision computing services, like server time and network storage, automatically. No communication with the service provider will be necessary. Customers of cloud services can view their cloud services, track their usage, and provision and de-provision services by logging into their cloud accounts through a web self-service portal.</p></div></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>💻 Broad Network Access</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><p>Broad network connectivity is another crucial aspect of cloud computing. Through a network and on portable devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs, we can access cloud services. A private cloud employs a local area network, whereas a public cloud uses the internet. Broad network access and cloud computing both rely heavily on latency and bandwidth since they have an impact on service quality.</p></div></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>📝 Resource Pooling</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><p>With resource pooling, multiple customers can share physical resources using a multi-tenant model. Based on demand, this model distributes and redistributes real and virtual resources. Customers can share the same applications or infrastructure with multi-tenancy while still retaining their privacy and security. Customers may be able to designate the location of their resources at a higher level of abstraction, such as a country, state, or data centre, even though they won't know the precise location of their resources. Customers can pool a variety of resources, including memory, computing power, and bandwidth.</p></div></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>🔗 Rapid Elasticity</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><p>Cloud services can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, so customers can scale quickly based on demand, thus making it highly scalable. The capabilities available for provisioning are practically unlimited. Customers can use these features whenever they want and in whatever amount. Customers can scale cloud capacity, cost, and usage without incurring additional contracts or charges. We won't need to acquire computer hardware thanks to quick elasticity. </p></div></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>⚙️ Measured Service</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div><p>A metering capability in cloud systems optimises resource utilisation at an abstraction level appropriate for the type of service. For storage, processing, bandwidth, and users, for instance, we can utilise a metered service. A pay-for-what-you-use model is used to base payments on the customer's actual consumption. Consumers and service providers benefit from a transparent experience that is created by monitoring, managing, and reporting resource use.</p></div></div></div></details><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-have-a-look-at-some-of-the-most-used-cloud-storage-services">Lets have a look at some of the most used Cloud Storage Services<a href="#lets-have-a-look-at-some-of-the-most-used-cloud-storage-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lets have a look at some of the most used Cloud Storage Services" title="Direct link to Lets have a look at some of the most used Cloud Storage Services">​</a></h2><br><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Most Used Cloud Storage Services" src="/assets/images/most-used-cloud-storage-services-56caeaf20934163f276dc7a4eb3619b0.png" width="1233" height="849" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Most used Cloud Storage Services</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Google Drive is by far the most popular cloud storage service in the world, with an use rate of <strong>94.44 percent</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Project management is a wild way to make sure things are progressing as they should. There is a project management technique for everything. Well, almost everything. I haven't found a project managing concept to overcome my feelings of procrastination. Someone might create it one day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-really-is-open-source">What really <em>is</em> Open Source?<a href="#what-really-is-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-really-is-open-source" title="Direct link to what-really-is-open-source">​</a></h2><p>If you're the engineering type of person that tackles humanity's problems and urgent needs by bringing together an entire community and building a "project" with them, you'll want to know about <strong>Open source</strong>. Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation. </p><p>Here it is again in bigger letters, for impact:</p><blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-refers-to-a-philosophy-of-software-development-that-emphasizes-collaboration-transparency-and-community-driven-innovation">Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.<a href="#open-source-refers-to-a-philosophy-of-software-development-that-emphasizes-collaboration-transparency-and-community-driven-innovation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation." title="Direct link to Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.">​</a></h3></blockquote><p>And now you know what open source is. <em>In theory, this blog post could be done!</em></p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="beyond-the-marketing-standpoint">Beyond the marketing standpoint<a href="#beyond-the-marketing-standpoint" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Beyond the marketing standpoint" title="Direct link to Beyond the marketing standpoint">​</a></h3><p>Technology is a concept which is ever-changing in how it is defined, its magnitude and how we as engineers develop it. In the world of technology we always find "buzz words" which reflect the recent advancements which are so efficient that they are slowly brought within the industry as a standard way of working on projects, as a team.</p><p>One such "buzz word" in the area of software development and project management is open source. Open source is a way of working on a software typically developed in a public, collaborative manner, with the source code made freely available to anyone who wants to use, modify, or distribute it. The term "open source" was coined in 1998 by a group of people in the software industry who wanted to create a new model of software development that was more collaborative and community-driven.</p><p>Open source software is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers and contributors, who work together to improve the software and fix bugs. Consider your <strong>homework</strong>: a dry document which contains things here and there which you know is very incomplete. If you have a good enough personality <em>(which I don't)</em>, you send this document to all your classmates who start doing bits of your homework.</p><p><em>The result?</em> A fine specimen of a document which the entire class can show to your teachers for great marks! What you just did here was open sourcing your homework and let your student community work on it to create a more appealing document which is now complete.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-open-source-doesnt-stop-there">But open source doesn't stop there<a href="#but-open-source-doesnt-stop-there" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But open source doesn't stop there" title="Direct link to But open source doesn't stop there">​</a></h3><p>Imagine your homework to be your project, your classmates to be your community. This community observes your project and suggests various improvements within it. Be it suggesting simple changes of changing the fonts or re-working the already existing complex APIs and queries.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Example of suggestions" src="/assets/images/meme-3f02107546e1509819bbf9cf8f9832fc.jpg" width="677" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>A simple conversation between a contributor and a project developer</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Another way to look at open source can be building the big <strong>Lego City</strong> together, block by block. Everyone can add their own pieces to what has been constructed so far and everyone can see how the city is made. In this way, everyone can make the city better and use it how they want.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Software Engineers" src="/assets/images/budding-062eaa508fb2d9a041277969ac4ae620.jpg" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Budding software engineers collaborating to build their project</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Open source is a great way to bring like-minded developers together. Everybody around you, be a fresher student or an industry experienced individual, has had to encounter with open source technologies without even realizing it. From something we daily use like <strong>Android</strong> to <strong>Linux</strong>: the operating system used by many corporates and tech giants, there's no saying what the next big thing will be.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Open Source" src="/assets/images/open-8953a127882dbb7f6a3c79eceaa7660e.jpg" width="659" height="499" class="img_ev3q"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><em>Python, Dart, React, MongoDB, even this text box is open source</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's about the gist of what I wished to express regarding open source. Surely that's not everything but I do look forward to go in-depth into this topic and talk about various different things which excite me! Do look forward to upcoming blogposts and reach me out for any constructive criticism, if any, for the future blogposts.</p>]]></content:encoded>
